## Description

I upgraded my portfolio webpage using my React skills. It is a single-page application built completely from scratch and deployed to GitHub Page. This application uses the following packages and dependencies: 
- [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev)
- [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Material UI library](https://mui.com/) 

From the design side, here are a few challenges I decided to take:

- Mobile-first design.
- A color scheme generator [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) distinguishes from the default Bootstrap theme or unstyled HTML sites. 
- The `Material UI` library works great with React.js for Styling. 

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Solution

This is a single-page application for a web developer's portfolio. The portfolio is presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer component, which is appeared on multiple pages:

* A single `Header` component: The header is presented with the name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.

* A single `Navigation` component: Within the header, the navbar is used to conditionally render About Me, Project, Contact, and Resume sections.

* A single `Icons` component: The icons component is presented with Phone, Email, Github, and LinkedIn `Material UI` icons with links. I tested to use the `Material UI` library only on this component.

* A single `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages.

When the portfolio website loads the first time, the About Me title and section are selected by default. The About Me section includes a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about me.

The Portfolio section includes titled images of five of the developer’s applications. For each project that is featured in the portfolio, including the following:

- An image of the deployed application 
- The title of the project
- A link to the deployed application
- A link to the corresponding GitHub repository.

The Contact section includes a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message. When I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, I receive a notification that this field is required. Also, the email address field is validated by the application using a helper function in the back-end.

The Resume section includes a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies.
